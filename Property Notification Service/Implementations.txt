1. you can use the feature of this Service once you implement the "NotificationHandler" interface.
2. All you need is to get the object of "WatchServiceManager" and register the properties in property files to start watching.

eg.

WatchServiceManager wsm = WatchServiceManager.GetInstance();
String file = "E:\\file.properties";

##Registering for a property to watch##

wsm.Register(file, "property_name",caller_object); /*caller_object is "this"*/

##DeRegistering for a property(or set of properties) that were being watched##

wsm.DeRegister(file, "property_name",caller_object); /*caller_object is "this"*/

##you can also use set of properties for Registering or Deregistering
You need to create a HashSet of property names and pass HashSet as the second argument in Register()/DeRegister() function.
